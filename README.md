# Automatic File Organizer

Automatically organizes files in a directory by their file type.  

## Features
-  **Automatic file type detection** – Sorts files based on their extensions.  
-  **Dynamic folder creation** – Creates folders automatically for new file types.  
-  **Duplicate-safe** – Files with the same name in a folder are skipped.  
-  **Case-insensitive** – `.PNG` and `.png` are treated as the same type.
